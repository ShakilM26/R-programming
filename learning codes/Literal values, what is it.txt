# Literal Values 

# Literal value is part of a statement or expression used exactly as intended for interpretation.
# example: 10 & 20 are literal values cz they literally represent the numbers 10 and 20.

# In R, there are five basic data types:
# 1. Logical 2. Integer 3. Numeric 4. Character 5. Complex

#***************************************
# Logical

# with the Logical data type, there are two literals, 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' or 'T' and 'F'
# R is case-sensitive 

#***************************************
# Numeric (decimal/real numbers)
# 10, 20 - Integer
# 0.50, 3.14 - Decimal 

# R considers any number (integer or decimal) a Numeric literal

# In programming terminology, we call a program code and each instruction (line) in that code a line of code.
